# İstiklal Marşı [^1]
```
Fear not! The red banner that ripples in this dawn, shall fade not,
Before the last hearth that is ablaze within my homeland is extinguished.
It is the star of my people, which shall shine;
It is mine; only it belongs to my people.
```
```
Frown not, I beseech you, oh you coy crescent!
Smile upon my heroic nation once! What is this violence, what for is this rage?
Or our blood which we shed for you shall not be worthy afterwards…
Freedom is the right of my God-worshipping nation.
```
```
Since the beginning I have lived free, I live in freedom,
What madman shall fetter me? I would be surprised.
Like a roaring flood I am, I would trample my banks, I would exceed,
I shall tear mountains apart, exceed the Expanses and overflow.
```
```
If the steel armored wall surrounds the horizons of the West,
I have a borderline like my faithful chest.
You are mighty, fear not! How can this faith be drowned,
By the single toothed beast they call "civilization"?
```
```
Comrade! Do not ever let ignobles visit our homeland,
Shield your chest, this disgraceful offense shall be stopped.
The days promised to you by God shall arise,
Who knows, perhaps tomorrow, perhaps even sooner than tomorrow.
```
```
View not the soil you tread on as mere Earth – recognize it!
And think about the shroudless thousands who lie so nobly beneath you.
You are the glorious son of a martyr – take shame, grieve not your ancestors!
Unhand not, even when you are promised worlds, this heavenly homeland.
```
```
Who would not sacrifice their life for this paradise of a country?
Martyrs would burst forth should one simply squeeze the soil! Martyrs!
May God take my life, my loved ones, and all possessions from me if He wills,
But let Him not deprive me of my one true homeland in the world.
```
```
Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that,
No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples.
These adhans and their testimonies are the foundations of my religion,
And may their noble sound prevail thunderously across my eternal homeland.
```
```
For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate, a thousand times in ecstasy,
And tears of blood shall, oh Lord, spill out from my every wound,
And my lifeless body shall burst forth from the earth like an eternal spirit,
Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.[xii]
```
```
So ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh you glorious crescent,
So that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy!
Neither you nor my kin shall ever be extinguished!
For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag;
For independence is the absolute right of my God-worshipping nation!
```

[^2]: Despite being written by Mehmet Âkif Ersoy, he has excluded the Independence March from his book *Safahat*, he clearly states the poem is gifted to the Turkish Nation, and ends his words with "...may the God not let another Independence March be written."
